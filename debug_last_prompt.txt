Look at this Open Face Chinese Poker (Pineapple) screenshot.
The screen is split into two areas:
1. OPPONENT (Top Half): Visible face-up cards here are "dead cards".
2. PLAYER (Bottom Half):
   - HAND: New cards dealt at the very bottom (3 or 5 cards).
   - BOARD: Player's 3 rows (Front/Middle/Back) above the hand.

Identify card codes (Rank + Suit, e.g., Ah, Td, 2s).
- Rank: A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
- Suit: h, d, c, s

Return a JSON object:
{
  "hand": ["Ah", "Kc", "Td"],       // Player's new cards (bottom)
  "board": {                         // Player's placed cards
    "front": [],
    "middle": [],
    "back": []
  },
  "opponent": ["Ks", "Qs", "Js"]     // All visible cards in TOP half
}

Use "??" for unclear cards. Return ONLY JSON.
